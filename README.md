## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 

I cannot get ESLint to work at all. Both Transpiling and Jest are working, and those tests passed. I have written the test for Cypress, however, when testing it, I get an error with the Importing and Exporting that was mentioned in one of the other tests. It does not give a description, just that there is an error on those 2. 

That being said, I think I have enough work to get a 5 or 6 on this assignment. If I could have gotten either to work, maybe a 7 or 8.

## Self-Reflection:


### How long it took me to finish this?
At least 2 hours, give or take. I know I spent about 45 mins to complete Transpiling and Jest, and about 75 to 90 mins on the other 2 trying to figure out what is going on with them.
